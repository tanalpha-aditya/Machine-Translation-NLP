# Machine-Translation-NLP

## About

This repo is an implementation of transformer based machine translation system.
Self-attention is a mechanism used in deep learning and natural language processing, primarily in models like Transformers, to capture dependencies and relationships between different elements (such as words or tokens) within a sequence of data. It is particularly effective for tasks involving sequences, such as natural language understanding and generation, because it allows the model to weigh and consider all other elements in the sequence when processing a specific element.
